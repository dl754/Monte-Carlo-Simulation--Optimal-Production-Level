# Newsvendor Model with Monte Carlo Simulation-Optimal Production Level

This project is an implementation of the Newsvendor Model, a well-known optimization model used in inventory management. The model is used to determine the optimal production level for a product with uncertain demand. Monte Carlo Simulation is used to generate demand scenarios and find the optimal production level that maximizes expected profit.

* Created a program simulation written in Python that will generate a recommendation given a set of parameters
* Parameters: unit price, retail price, cost of disposing, and number of units to manufacture

## Background
The Newsvendor Model is commonly used in inventory management to determine the optimal production level for a product with uncertain demand. It is called the newsvendor model because it is similar to a newspaper vendor who must decide how many papers to order each day without knowing exactly how many customers will buy them.

The newsvendor model assumes that the product has a fixed cost and a variable cost, and that the demand is uncertain and follows a known probability distribution. The goal of the model is to find the optimal production level that maximizes expected profit.
