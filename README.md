# Newsvendor with Monte Carlo Simulation-Optimal Production Level

This project is an implementation of the Newsvendor Model, a well-known optimization model used in inventory management. The model is used to determine the optimal production level for a product with uncertain demand. Monte Carlo Simulation is used to generate demand scenarios and find the optimal production level that maximizes expected profit.

* Created a program simulation written in Python to generate a recommended production quantity based on the given set of parameters
* Parameters: unit price, retail price, cost of disposing, and number of units to manufacture

## Background

Your business analyst forecasts that the demand for Product X is normally distributed with a mean of 150 and a standard deviation of 20. The total cost of manufacturing and logistics for each unit is $28.50, and you sell the earbuds at a retail price of $150.00. Any earbuds not sold within one month need to be disposed of in an environmentally sustainable way, which will cost the company $8.50 per unit

## Requirements<a name="Requirements"></a>

* Python 3
* numpy
* matplotlib

## Usage

To run the simulation, simply run the newsvendor.py script. You can adjust the input parameters in the script to match your specific product and market.
