# Newsvendor Model with Monte Carlo Simulation-Optimal Production Level

This project is an implementation of the Newsvendor Model, a well-known optimization model used in inventory management. The model is used to determine the optimal production level for a product with uncertain demand. Monte Carlo Simulation is used to generate demand scenarios and find the optimal production level that maximizes expected profit.

* Created a program simulation written in Python that will generate a recommendation given a set of parameters
* Parameters: unit price, retail price, cost of disposing, and number of units to manufacture
